Thermal (heat transfer) analysis
In recent years, with the expansion of the use of electric motors in various industries, the need for motors with
limited dimensions and high torque and power density at the same time has increased. To design and construct such
a motor, in addition to electromagnetic analysis, we also need thermal analysis. Because practically, there are 
thermal limits that determine the rated power of the electric machine. On the other hand, the performance of 
various parts of the electric motor, such as magnets, insulations, and bearings, highly depends on the operating
temperature. Therefore, thermal analysis is very important for electric motors. This analysis should cover fluid 
issues in addition to solids issues; In other words, besides the motor, we must also consider the internal and 
external fluids of the motor. This fluid has a significant effect on the cooling of the motor, and this fluid
causes the main convective currents of the electric motor.
